# FASTQ Files
This folder contains the raw FASTQ files for sequencing data. The files include paired-end read sequences:
---
```
Dis.R1.fastq.gz: Forward reads for the Dis dataset

Dis.R2.fastq.gz: Reverse reads for the Dis dataset

R1.fastq.gz: Forward reads for the primary dataset

R2.fastq.gz: Reverse reads for the primary dataset
```
---
These files will be used as input for downstream processing steps in the pipeline.
