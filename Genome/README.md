# Reference Genome (hg38)

The **hg38** (also known as **GRCh38**) is the 38th and latest major build of the Homo sapiens reference genome released by the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC).

### Download hg38:

To download the hg38 reference genome, use the following commands:
```bash
wget http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/hg38.fa.gz
gunzip hg38.fa.gz
```

### Genome Folder Structure:

The **Genome** folder should contain the following files:
```
Genome/
├── hg38.fa              # Reference FASTA (GRCh38/hg38)
├── hg38.fa.fai          # FASTA index (generated by samtools)
├── hg38.dict            # Sequence dictionary (from GATK)
├── hg38.fa.bwt          # BWA index files
├── hg38.fa.amb          # BWA index files
├── hg38.fa.pac          # BWA index files
├── hg38.fa.sa           # BWA index files
```

This structure is essential for ensuring that the reference genome is properly indexed and ready for alignment and variant calling in the pipeline.

### Key Highlights:
- **Release:** December 2013
- **Build ID:** GRCh38 / hg38
- **Organism:** Homo sapiens (human)
- **Assembly Improvements:**
  - Corrected misassembled regions from hg19
  - Added alternate haplotypes for complex regions (e.g., MHC)
  - Improved centromere representation
  - Updated mitochondrial DNA
- **Coordinate System:** 1-based
- **Chromosome Naming:** chr1, chr2, ..., chrX, chrY, chrM

### Reference Files You Need:

To use hg38 with this pipeline, ensure the following files are present:

- **hg38.fa** — the FASTA sequence
- **hg38.fa.fai** — index generated by `samtools faidx`
- **hg38.dict** — sequence dictionary from GATK
- **hg38.fa.*** — BWA index files (.amb, .ann, .bwt, .pac, .sa)
